 <h1>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</h1>
<p>It is widely and generally acknowledged that the gateway to the survival of a nation scientifically and technologically is scientific literacy which can only be achieved through science education (Bilesanmi-Awoderu and Oludipe, 2012). On this note, science education has been recognized as a vital tool for achieving sustainable development. Science education is regarded as a veritable test for economic and technological development in the areas of self-reliance and self-sufficiency because it is the platform and the process that leads to the production of citizens who are creative, critical, analytical and rational (Enuma and Onah, 2017). Science education is also the backbone of developing countries because sustainable development of economy and society is achievable if knowledge in science education is embraced (Enemuo, Anyaduba and Ezeaka, 2019). This is because science educations assist the learners in developing certain attitudes, knowledge and skills regarding the order in nature (Suleiman and Mathew, 2010). Therefore, there is need to produce scientifically and technologically literate citizens that can sustain the natural environment and improve national development.</p>
 <p>Chemistry which is essential for understanding various everyday processes such as cooking cleaning and environmental issues, making it relevant to everyday life (Theodore L. et al., 2017) is an exact and a core science subject in Nigerian secondary schools. Its teaching often requires creativity and improvisation. To make chemistry concepts comprehensible to students, chemistry teachers must employ creative teaching methods and be prepared to respond to queries and explain concepts in a typical manner (Nbina, 2012). Teachers with multiphase background, training and qualification have over the years, dominated the teaching profession in Nigeria. With the emergence of new job opportunities, the teaching profession began to lose the best of its brain. Consequently, those who could not get better jobs stay on new entrants, using it as a stepping stone, while others who were not trained to teach but have no other job joined the teaching profession (Arisekola, 2017). </p>
 <p>Furthermore, as a fundamental science subject, Chemistry occupies a pivotal place in the secondary school curriculum, shaping students understanding of natural phenomena and scientific principles (Johnstone, 2006). It is indispensable for those aspiring to pursue careers in science, medicine, engineering, and various other fields (UNESCO, 2018). Chemistry education at the secondary school level is a fundamental component of science education, providing students with the necessary knowledge and skills to understand the composition, structure, properties, and reactions of matter (Gabriel S. et al., 2021). It is an exact and a core science subject in Nigerian secondary schools and it plays a pivotal role in preparing students for further studies and careers in various scientific and technological fields.  </p>
 <p>The major problem that the Nigerian secondary education sector is facing currently is the students’ poor performance in core subjects, especially English language and Science and Technology. Researches of Kurumeh and Imoko (2008) revealed low academic achievement of students in Science and Technology at all levels of education in Nigeria, from primary schools (Basic Education) to secondary schools. This entails that the foundation of science and technology in the primary school level is weak and is unfortunately carried on to the junior and senior secondary levels, therefore contributing to the poor academic performance of many students in Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE).</p>
<p>Notably, a lot of literatures have been documented on Chemistry teachers’ perception because recommendable attentions have been given to the perceptions they hold about their teaching. Ahmed and Aziz (2009) stated that data collections of chemistry teachers teaching obtained from students/learners provide a valuable result since their opinions are “highlighted by demanding and exciting teachers”. Ahmed and Aziz (2009) explained that the students’ perception towards the chemistry teachers teaching influence the effectiveness of teaching and learning of chemistry positively and it provides a meaningful and fruitful suggestion for the improvement of their Chemistry teacher practice. Ahmed and Aziz further stated that learners will develop a clear insight of the idea that is being offered by their Chemistry teachers if they perceive the teacher classroom condition to be cooperative rather than competitive. Rawnsley (1997) also argued that if the students perceived their Chemistry teachers to be highly supportive and pave way for them to play an essential part in teaching and learning activity of Chemistry, they will establish a more positive attitude towards the teaching.</p>
