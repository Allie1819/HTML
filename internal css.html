 <p>Notably, a lot of literatures have been documented on Chemistry teachers’ perception because recommendable attentions have been given to the perceptions they hold about their teaching. Ahmed and Aziz (2009) stated that data collections of chemistry teachers teaching obtained from students/learners provide a valuable result since their opinions are “highlighted by demanding and exciting teachers”. Ahmed and Aziz (2009) explained that the students’ perception towards the chemistry teachers teaching influence the effectiveness of teaching and learning of chemistry positively and it provides a meaningful and fruitful suggestion for the improvement of their Chemistry teacher practice. <blockquote>Ahmed and Aziz further stated that learners will develop a clear insight of the idea that is being offered by their</blockquote> Chemistry teachers if they perceive the teacher classroom condition to be cooperative rather than competitive. Rawnsley (1997) also argued that if the students perceived their Chemistry teachers to be highly supportive and pave way for them to play an essential part in teaching and learning activity of Chemistry, they will establish a more positive attitude towards the teaching.</p>
