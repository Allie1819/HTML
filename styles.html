<p style="color: red;"> <b>Notably, a lot of literatures have been documented on Chemistry teachers’ </b>perception because recommendable attentions have been given to the perceptions they hold about their teaching. Ahmed and Aziz (2009) stated that data collections of chemistry teachers teaching obtained from students/learners provide a valuable result since their opinions are “highlighted by demanding and exciting teachers”.<strong> Ahmed and Aziz (2009) explained that the students’</strong> perception towards the chemistry teachers teaching influence the effectiveness of teaching and learning of chemistry positively and it provides a meaningful and fruitful suggestion for the improvement of their Chemistry teacher practice.<i> Ahmed and Aziz further stated that learners will develop </i>a clear insight of the idea that is being offered by their Chemistry teachers if they perceive the teacher classroom condition to be cooperative rather than competitive.<em>Rawnsley (1997) also argued that if the students perceived </em>their Chemistry teachers to be highly supportive and pave way for them to play an essential part in teaching and learning activity of Chemistry,<del> they will establish a more positive attitude towards the teaching.</del> </p>
